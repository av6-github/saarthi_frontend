We're going to take control and build some momentum!\n\nFirst, let's ditch the overwhelming feeling.  Instead of focusing on everything at once, let's focus on one tiny thing, a super-small win.  What's ONE thing you enjoy, something that makes you happy, even just for a little bit?  Maybe it's listening to a song, watching a funny video, or even just stretching.  Let's schedule that in right now.  What time can we squeeze in 5 minutes of pure joy?\n",

It obscures the shore, making the path ahead seem indistinct, but the lake itself remains, calm and deep beneath the mist.  Your confusion is the fog; it doesn't change the essence of who you are or what you are capable of.\n\nLet's separate the story you are telling yourself from the facts of the situation.  What is one single, concrete thing you can focus on right now, even for just a few minutes, to clear a small space within the fog?\n",
