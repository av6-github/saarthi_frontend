We're going to tackle this, one step at a time, and you're going to feel SO much better.  We're not going to let this get the best of you.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the pain.  Breakups are tough, especially long ones. It's okay to feel sad, angry, confused...all of it.  But we're not going to stay stuck here.\n\nRight now, let's focus on something *you* can control:  taking care of *you*.  We're going to start with a small win.  How about a 15-minute walk?  Just a stroll around the block to clear your head.  Fresh air and movement do wonders.  Think of it as a mini-rebellion against the sadness.  Ready to do that right now?  Let's go!  We'll celebrate that walk when you're done.  You got this!\n",
