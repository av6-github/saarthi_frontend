This sense of being adrift, while disorienting, can also be a quiet invitation.\n\nPerhaps this feeling is not an absence, but a fertile space \u2013 much like standing at the edge of a great, unwritten map. The map itself does not dictate your journey; it merely waits for your first deliberate step, your first stroke of intention, to begin to reveal its contours. You do not need to chart the entire expedition at once, but rather to find the courage to place your foot down, to feel the ground beneath you, and discover where it might lead.\n\nWhat is one small, initial step you can commit to today, even if it feels like merely a whisper of a direction, to begin to draw your own map?",
